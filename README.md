# Stock Predictor - Integrated Application

This is a stock prediction tool featuring a React and Tailwind CSS frontend served by a Python Flask backend. Users can input a stock ticker, select a forecast period, and view simulated price predictions, charts, and investment advice, all generated by the backend API.

The application is structured as a single deployable unit, making it suitable for hosting as a "Web Service" on platforms like Render.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application that serves the frontend and provides the backend API.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies (Flask, Gunicorn).
- `Procfile`: Defines the command Render uses to start the web server (Gunicorn running the Flask app).
- `static/`: Contains all frontend assets.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML entry point for the React app.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application.
  - `App.tsx`: The main React application component.
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions used by the frontend.
  - `constants.ts`: Frontend constants (e.g., forecast day options, popular tickers for datalist).
  - `metadata.json`: Application metadata (for informational purposes).
  - `components/`: Directory containing all React components (Header, Footer, StockForm, etc.).
  - `services/`: Directory for frontend service logic.
    - `stockService.ts`: Contains the function to fetch data from the Flask backend API.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Running Locally

1.  **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    flask run 
    # Or python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Deployment to Render (Web Service)

This application is designed to be deployed as a "Web Service" on [Render](https://render.com/).

### Prerequisites:

1.  A Render account.
2.  Your project code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### Steps:

1.  **Push to Git:**
    Ensure all files (including `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, and the `static/` directory with all frontend assets) are committed to your Git repository.

2.  **Create a New Web Service on Render:**
    *   Log in to your Render dashboard.
    *   Click "New +" and select "Web Service".

3.  **Connect Your Repository:**
    *   Choose your Git provider and select the repository containing this project.
    *   Give your service a name (e.g., `stock-predictor-app`).

4.  **Configure Settings:**
    *   **Environment**: Select `Python`. Render should detect `requirements.txt` and `Procfile`.
    *   **Region**: Choose a region closest to your users.
    *   **Branch**: Select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main` or `master`).
    *   **Root Directory**: Leave as is if your `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `Procfile` are in the root of the repository.
    *   **Build Command**: Render typically infers this for Python projects (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`). You can usually leave this as default or ensure it's:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **Start Command**: Render should detect this from your `Procfile`. If you didn't use a `Procfile` or want to override, set it to:
        ```
        gunicorn app:app
        ```
        (Make sure `gunicorn` is in your `requirements.txt`).

5.  **Deploy:**
    *   Choose a plan (Render offers a free tier for Web Services).
    *   Click "Create Web Service".
    *   Render will build your application by installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` and then run it using the start command (from `Procfile` or your manual setting).
    *   You'll get a unique URL (e.g., `your-service-name.onrender.com`).

### API and Frontend Interaction:

*   The Flask app serves `static/index.html` for the root path and any client-side routes.
*   The React frontend, once loaded, makes API calls to `/api/predict` (a relative path) on the same domain, which are handled by the Flask backend.
*   Flask's `static_folder` setting ensures that requests for `/static/*` (like `/static/index.tsx`, `/static/components/Header.tsx`) are correctly served from the `static/` directory in your project.

That's it! Your integrated Stock Predictor application should now be live on Render as a Web Service.
